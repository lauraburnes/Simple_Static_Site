          <p>Winner of the 2012 Bloom Chapbook Prize for Poetry, selected by contest judge Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.</p>

          <p> A wonderful chapbook that centers on films from the 30's - '50's and uses them as metaphors for understanding contemporary life. While reflecting back on the images, characters, and plots from old films, and the stars who populated them, Cihlar feeds his own experiences through the lenses of these classics, and the result is a doubling - the past projected onto the present, and the present projected onto the past. </p> </div>

            <p> <i>"When the world rights itself, bears will turn into bulls."</i> </p>

          <p> After the recent Wall Street crash, we struggled to understand what had happened economically. Bankers, politicians, and newscasters contorted language in new ways to express and ultimately obscure and perpetuate an old story of American life: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The eighteen poems in this chapbook highlight the bizarre and at times humorous ways in which language is perverted to support power, even while showing how language and story insist on telling on a greater truth. As Modern Maturity asks, "What if one day the men you trusted/ walked out, and suddenly,/ you woke up?" </p></div>
