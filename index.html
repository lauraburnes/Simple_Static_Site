        <h3> Rancho Nostalgia </h3>

          <p> "Keep reaching into the past/To grab something new"</p>

          <p> “James Cihlar’s poems in Rancho Nostalgia contain the twisted love of a stage mom and the nervous energy of an Oscar Show producer. Here’s a cinephilic poet who can pretty much direct anything, even the transformation of Sherlock Holmes into a ‘wharf rat.’ Of course, Cihlar can’t shut off his camera. A woman’s face ‘is the Wrigley building lit at night.’ Teddy Roosevelt and Winston Churchill are ‘rag dolls in future’s toy box.’ And Cihlar’s alter ego ‘parades down Wall Street wearing a diadem of wheat.’ At one point, he flatly says, ‘Inspiration comes when we don’t want it.’ Lucky for us he has the conviction to be willfully misguided. Every page in this book possesses at least one tiny miracle.” —Steve Fellner, author of The Weary World Rejoices </p>

        <h3> Undoing </h3>

          <p>"Life starts on the inside, / with the burnt sienna tile of the fireplace, / the leaded glass window, the maple floors."</p>

          <p> James Cihlar's debut collection is a generous yet unflinching portrait of the unraveling of an American family. Always honest and brilliantly crafted, these poems face life head-on. The poet subtly pulls back the layers of myth and willful misunderstanding that trap so many of us in unfulfilled dreams, and exposes the true and sometimes beautiful lives that lie underneath. Cihlar's poems are mirrors, filled with flashes of the wonderful and the dreadful, the complicated and conflicted faces that we each wear, and the masks behind which we sometimes hide. Highly recommended! - Minnesota Poetry Reader </p>

      <h2>Chapbooks </h2>

        <h3> A Conversation with my Imaginary Daughter </h3>

          <p> “Unity is the moment when living becomes history.” </p>

          <p>Winner of the 2012 Bloom Chapbook Prize for Poetry, selected by contest judge Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon.</p>

          <p> A wonderful chapbook that centers on films from the 30's - '50's and uses them as metaphors for understanding contemporary life. While reflecting back on the images, characters, and plots from old films, and the stars who populated them, Cihlar feeds his own experiences through the lenses of these classics, and the result is a doubling - the past projected onto the present, and the present projected onto the past. </p>

        <h3> Metaphysical Bailout </h3>

          <p> "When the world rights itself, bears will turn into bulls" </p>

          <p> After the recent Wall Street crash, we struggled to understand what had happened economically. Bankers, politicians, and newscasters contorted language in new ways to express and ultimately obscure and perpetuate an old story of American life: the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. The eighteen poems in this chapbook highlight the bizarre and at times humorous ways in which language is perverted to support power, even while showing how language and story insist on telling on a greater truth. As Modern Maturity asks, "What if one day the men you trusted/ walked out, and suddenly,/ you woke up?" </p>
