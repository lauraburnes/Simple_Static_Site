          <p> “James Cihlar’s poems in Rancho Nostalgia contain the twisted love of a stage mom and the nervous energy of an Oscar Show producer. Here’s a cinephilic poet who can pretty much direct anything, even the transformation of Sherlock Holmes into a ‘wharf rat.’ Of course, Cihlar can’t shut off his camera. A woman’s face ‘is the Wrigley building lit at night.’ Teddy Roosevelt and Winston Churchill are ‘rag dolls in future’s toy box.’ And Cihlar’s alter ego ‘parades down Wall Street wearing a diadem of wheat.’ At one point, he flatly says, ‘Inspiration comes when we don’t want it.’ Lucky for us he has the conviction to be willfully misguided. Every page in this book possesses at least one tiny miracle.” —Steve Fellner, author of The Weary World Rejoices </p>

          <p> James Cihlar's debut collection is a generous yet unflinching portrait of the unraveling of an American family. Always honest and brilliantly crafted, these poems face life head-on. The poet subtly pulls back the layers of myth and willful misunderstanding that trap so many of us in unfulfilled dreams, and exposes the true and sometimes beautiful lives that lie underneath. Cihlar's poems are mirrors, filled with flashes of the wonderful and the dreadful, the complicated and conflicted faces that we each wear, and the masks behind which we sometimes hide. Highly recommended! - Minnesota Poetry Reader </p> </div>
